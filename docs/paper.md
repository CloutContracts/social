#### Abstract
> Social is an algorithmic stable coin for social influence, built off of UMA or Universal Market Access Protocols, CloutContracts (CCS), and on the Celo network. It is based off of quantitative algorithmic stabilization provided by a social coin's percieved cryptographic value. Social is a utility and this technology is conceptual. How Social works, is by integrating statistical averages for CCS and social tokens staked within its network. It integrates universal market access in regards to CCS data, and CloutContracts is a smart contracts platform for social influencers and creators. Eventually, Social, as an algorithmically pegged stable coin, will create a standard for social influence. Also, decentralized finance applications might peg cryptographic value to Social as a utility. Social can even integrate decentralized oracles in order to process data much quicker over time, once the network becomes large enough. Since CloutContracts integrates social networks accross various different places such as DeSo/BitClout, Minds, Peepeth, Steemit, etc., one can eventually establish some sort of cryptographic metric in regards to social infleunce and develop complex algorithms centered around social physics and human behavioral processes. The same type of mathematical models that apply to quantitiative algorithms in the stock market for example, can apply to social influence. The same also applies for mathematical models modeled after games like chess and go. Social as a stable coin, creates another complexity that CloutContracts can use to create new mathematical standards around market access data that it already has, and could be quite critical. Social influence as a market, and as some sort of utility, can then be looked at as either a metric, mathematical bet, or speculative model for new forms of political and human societies.
